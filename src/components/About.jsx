            <p className="mx-auto w-11/12 text-lg tracking-wider leading-8 text-justify">Hello! My name is Syed Mehdi Zafar. Currently I am pursuing Bachelors of Engineering
             program in Computer Systems from NED University of Engineering and Technology and right now I am in my 7th semester.
            Throughout my university life I have come across multiple domains in Computer Science such as Hardware Design, Computer 
            Networking, Data Science, Software Development, Machine Learning, etc. After having a taste of all these different 
            areas, the area where I enjoyed working the most is Software Development specifically Web Development. After discovering
             my area of interest I have been working tirelessly to develop my skills in this particular domain. For the past 1.5 - 2 years 
             I have been working on different undergraduate and personal projects. I started my Web Development journey with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, PHP and MySQL.
              Then I moved on working with Vanilla JavaScript. For the past year I have been working on React JS. During this time I also explored MERN stack.
               Recently I have started using Next JS. I am truly passionate about Front-End Web Development and always willing to take on new challenges. </p>
